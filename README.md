## Security and Privacy Enhancements

To improve the security and privacy of the website, `rel="noopener noreferrer"` has been added to all anchor (`<a>`) tags that open links in a new tab or window (`target="_blank"`). 

### What This Change Does:
- **Security:** The `rel="noopener"` attribute prevents the newly opened page from accessing the `window.opener` object of the original page, mitigating potential security risks.
- **Privacy:** The `rel="noreferrer"` attribute prevents the browser from sending the `Referer` header to the destination site, protecting user privacy by not revealing the URL of the original page.

These changes ensure a safer and more private browsing experience for users interacting with external and internal links on the site.

## Usage

- Once the project is set up, open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the webpage.
- To view other pages, navigate through the site's navigation links or directly open `store.html` or `contact.html`.
